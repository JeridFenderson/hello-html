    <p>I've been working on my 1973 Chevrolet C10 for about a good 3 years now, and everything I learned along the way is just so fascinating. When I started this project, I could tell you very little about cars and how they work. Now, let's just say I know my way around an engine.</p>

    <p>It all started when my good friend brought it home for the first time. One day, I knew that truck was going to be mine. She wasn't in the best of condition when I got her, but through trial and error, blood, sweat and tears, I've: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rewired the whole truck. Every single wire in that thing has been touched</li>
      <li>Replace the whole cooling system, to include installing electric fans</li>
      <li>Replaced the A/C system with a Vintage Air system</li>
      <li>Refurbished the interior. Reupholstered the seat, replaced the streering column, the works</li>
      <li>Replaced the head gaskets and seals on the engine</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And after all of that, I'm just getting started.</p>
